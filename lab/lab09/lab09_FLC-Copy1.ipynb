    "# Introduction to Linear Regression \n",
    "\n",
    "Before we get into the lab examples, it might be helpful for us to know a bit about linear regression first.\n",
    "\n",
    "Linear regression is simply a way to model relationships between two or more variables. For two variables, we use a familiar equation:\n",
    "$$y = mx+b$$\n",
    "Here, $x$ represents an independent (predictor) variable and $y$ represents a depended (predicted) variable. For consistency with other materials, we will instead write:\n",
    "$$y = \\beta_0 + \\beta_1 x$$\n",
    "as our model. \n",
    "\n",
    "Our goal with regression is to find the **best** linear equation that fits our data. By **best**, we mean the line that is the **closest** to all data points, when compared to any other line.\n",
    "\n",
    "## But wait, not all relationships are linear ... isn't this a bit simplistic?\n",
    "\n",
    "How astute of you! It's true, not all relationships are linear.\n",
    "\n",
    "However, many variables can be mathematically *transformed* so that the relationship can be modeled as linear. While we won't get into the details of such transformations here, this concept makes linear regression *impressively* powerful for a *huge* range of relationships between variables.\n",
    "\n",
    "To illustrate this, let's run the following code. Please do not change anything in the cell below.\n"

    "   1. **Averages** (means) of $x$ and $y$. These are usually notated as $\\bar{x}$ and $\\bar{y}$. \n",
    "   2. **Standard deviations** of $x$ and $y$ (notated as $s_x$ and $s_y$). These give us an idea of the general *spread* of the data.\n",
    "   3. **Correlation** between $x$ and $y$ (notated as $r$) this is a number between -1 and 1 that measures how much $x$ and $y$ are related. If they are perfectly related (i.e. no randomness in our linear data) and the slope of the relationship is *positive*, the correlation is 1. If they are perfectly related (i.e. no randomness in our linear data) and the slope of the relationship is *negative*, the correlation is -1. A correlation of 0 indicates no relationship.\n",
    "   4. **Residuals** (usually notated as $e_i$). If we consider a data point $(x_i,y_i)$ in our data set, residuals can be thought of as the deviation of the *actual* $y$-value ($y_i$) from the *predicted* $y$ value from the regression line (i.e. $y(x_i) = \\beta_0+\\beta_1 x_i$). In other words, residuals are defined as: $$ e_i = y_i - y(x_i) = y_i - \\beta_0-\\beta_1 x_i$$\n",
